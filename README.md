# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignment Solutions 2020
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments for Stanford's [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) "Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition" course (Spring 2020).
I used Pytorch in the necesary tasks in assignment 2 and assignment 3.
